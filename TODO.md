# TODO

* [X] gren-tui
* [ ] try devenv: https://devenv.sh/
* [ ] move TODOs from rust project
* [ ] move TODOs from taskfiles tasks
* [ ] "new" template should probably have default frontmatter (much easier to remove than to add manually)
* [ ] web/phone access

## Future Ideas / Questions

* [ ] Mobile app? See attempts at gleam/lustre+ionic: https://github.com/blaix/tasker-lustre/blob/main/src/tasker.gleam
